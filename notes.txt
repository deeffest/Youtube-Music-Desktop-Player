1.1.4 Update!
 
- All tooltips with fluent interface have been replaced by standard ones due to unstable operation.
- The tray icon is now displayed regardless of whether the window is hidden or not (if minimizing the window to the tray on closing is enabled in the settings).
- The tray menu now uses the standard interface instead of the fluent interface (due to a bug on the PyQtFluentWidgets side).
- Other changes and improvements.
